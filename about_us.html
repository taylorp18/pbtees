		<h3>What we're about</h3>
		<p>P.B. Tee's is a business started for and by college students. As someone paying tens of thousands of
		   dollars just to take classes and live in a dorm, we decided enough was enough with fashion costing 
		   hundreds more dollars on top of it all. <br><br> So, we make clothes that are well-made, sustainably sourced,
		   and, of course, stylish. We don't believe in making the price jump to several times what it
		   would cost at T.J. Maxx, just because of a logo. So we turn brands on their head, and sell them for a that price you (yes you) can 
		   actually afford.</p>
